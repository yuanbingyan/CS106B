Perfect Numbers
---------------

Q1. Roughly how long did it take your computer to do the search? How many perfect numbers were found and what were they?
A1. The first question I have no idea, because it is so fast that I can't capture the time pasted.
    The second question is four, they respectively are 6, 28, 496 and 8128.

Q2. Make a table of the timing results for `findPerfects` that you observed. (old-school table of text rows and columns is just fine)
A2. TODO

Q3. Does it take the same amount of work to compute `isPerfect` on the number 10
    as it does on the number 1000? Why or why not?
    Does it take the same amount of work for `findPerfects` to search the range of numbers from 1 ~ 1000
    as it does to search the numbers from 1000 ~ 2000? Why or why not?
A3. For the first problem, No, it doesn't. Because there is only one number '6' in the range of 1 ~ 10, but
    there are three numbers '6', '28', and '496' in the range of 1 ~ 1000.
    For the second problem, No, it doesn't either. Because there three numbers in the range of 1 ~ 1000,
    and there is no number in the range of 1000 ~ 2000.

Q4. Extrapolate from the data you gathered and make a prediction: how long will it take `findPerfects` to reach the fifth perfect number?
A4. TODO

Q5. Do any of the tests still pass even with this broken function? Why or why not?
A5. Yes. Because the function divisorSum's return value is 1, and a negative number isn't equal to 1.

Q6. Explain your testing strategy for `smarterSum` and how you chose your specific test cases that lead you to be confident the function is working correctly.
A6. TODO

Q7. Record your timing results for `findPerfectsSmarter` into a table.
A7. TODO

Q8. Make a prediction: how long will `findPerfectsSmarter` take to reach the fifth perfect number?
A8. TODO

Q9. Explain how you chose your specific test cases and why they lead you to be confident `findNthPerfectEuclid` is working correctly.
A9. TODO

Soundex
-------

Q10. What is the Soundex code for "Angelou"? What is the code for your own surname?
A10. TODO

Q11. Before writing any code, brainstorm your plan of attack and sketch how you might decompose the work into smaller tasks. Briefly describe your decomposition strategy.
A11. TODO

Q12. Think about one or more examples of a class of names that the Soundex system might not work well for. Explain what this class of names is and why the system might incorrectly group them or mis-categorize one of the names.
A12. TODO

Q13. Suppose you are a software engineer working for the U.S. government. You have been tasked with implementing a system that collects names as part of the Census survey and analyzes these names using a phonetic algorithm. Your boss suggests using Soundex and notes that the algorithm is only expected to work for ASCII-encoded strings, since supporting Unicode would require extra work and time. What would your response be and why? What representational harms might result from building a system that exclusively uses Soundex and/or ASCII?
A13. TODO
